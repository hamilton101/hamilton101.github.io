I started my journey at the VAC Lab with Professor Hamilton in May 2023 as a MUCEP student. Learning more about light fields drew me even further into the research being done in the lab, which led me to continue with my Honours thesis on light field frame translation. 
I really enjoyed and appreciated our discussions exploring solutions and the moments of finding small improvements along the way.
