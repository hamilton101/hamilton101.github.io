Arnob began his journey with the VAC Lab in 2025 for his Honours thesis that involved camera localization under the supervision of Professor Hamilton. Camera pose estimation is a common problem in many applications requiring a precise localization in the environment such as light field display simulator validation. The research interests of Arnob include VR/AR applications, and robotics. 
As a CS student in the Visual Computing concentration, his favorite programming language is Python, and his favorite aspect of CS is data visualization, i.e. making sense of numbers by turning them into colors.
