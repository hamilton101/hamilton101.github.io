In the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of completing a SURA internship under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Hamilton. This experience introduced me to research in computer science and helped me build a strong foundation in the field.

Since then, I have continued working in the lab through multiple research positions, including a Mitacs internship in 2024. Most recently, I completed my Honours thesis with his guidance and support, which allowed me to further develop my research skills and deepen my academic experience.
