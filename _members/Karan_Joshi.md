Karan Joshi is a senior undergraduate student at Memorial University of Newfoundland specializing in web development and machine learning/MLOps. He has been actively involved with the Visual Analytics and Computing (VAC) Lab since the summer of 2024, holding multiple 80-hour MUCEP research positions. In the summer of 2025, Karan continued with the lab as a part-time Web and MLOps Developer, where he built the foundation of the VacLab Machine-Learning Experimental System (VMES) ? a platform designed to remotely run and manage machine learning models on CAIR servers with a focus on usability and automation, reducing dependence on terminal-based workflows.

Working closely with Professor Matthew Hamilton and PhD candidate Nick, Karan has played a key role in transforming an academic concept into a practical, operational system. He is also a prospective master?s student, aiming to further his research in machine learning infrastructure and intelligent automation at Memorial University.
