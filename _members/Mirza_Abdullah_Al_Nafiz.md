I am a Master?s student in Computer Engineering, working on my final project. 

Originally from Bangladesh, I enjoy exploring new ideas, reading, and being in nature. 

I am especially keen on using AI in medical imaging, right now I am interested in deep learning for lesion detection. 

My background is in software engineering, and I have worked on projects ranging from web platforms to database systems and application architecture.
