I?m a 3rd-year Data Science student minoring in CS at MUN, with hands-on experience building and deploying end-to-end ML systems (Python, SQL, Linux/CI/CD) and I?m motivated to work on high-value projects that create real impact.
Outside of school/work, I?m big on fitness lifting and getting more consistent with running (even with the St. John?s wind) Constantly working on eating healthy whilst having a sweet tooth :)
