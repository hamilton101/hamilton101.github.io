I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science degree from the University of Tabriz and a Master?s degree in Artificial intelligence- Bioinformatics from Tarbiat Modares University. I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where my research focuses on artificial intelligence, particularly convolutional neural networks and related machine learning systems. Prior to entering academia, I accumulated over twelve years of industrial experience in software development and computer science.
