Samarasimha Reddy Chittamuru(SAMAR) is a maritime data analytics researcher specializing in ship performance monitoring, fuel consumption modeling, and emissions estimation. He has worked as a Research Collaborator at the National Research Council Canada under the Greening Government Fund, where he contributed to emission reduction studies for Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker vessels. His work focuses on analyzing high-resolution in-service sensor data to quantify vessel performance, operational efficiency, and environmental impact under real operating conditions.

He has strong experience in designing and maintaining data pipelines for large-scale maritime datasets, including hindcast environmental data integration and spatiotemporal joins with ship operational data. His research combines statistical methods and machine learning models to develop validated fuel consumption and emission estimation frameworks, including load-based empirical corrections aligned with regulatory reporting needs. His interests lie at the intersection of maritime engineering, data science, and sustainable shipping, with an emphasis on data-driven performance monitoring, scalable data infrastructure, and IMO-aligned decarbonization strategies.
